Environment - you are in the root of zig based tofu project

Target - fix building of zig documentation.

Problem - there are two zig modules in the project
 recipes
	├── recipes
	│   ├── cookbook.zig
	│   ├── MultiHomed.zig
	│   └── services.zig

 tofu - not all files shown
	├── src
	│   ├── ampe
	│   │   ├── IntrusiveQueue.zig
	│   │   ├── Reactor.zig
	│   │   ├── testHelpers.zig
	│   ├── ampe.zig
	│   ├── configurator.zig
	│   ├── message.zig
	│   ├── status.zig
	│   └── tofu.zig

 tofu contains main functionality
 recipes contains examples it depends on tofu

 After creation of documentation, showing of zig docs stuc, looks some problem with
 generation of docs.

IMPORTANT
    - Always ask if you need additional information
    - Never execute git commands automatically. Always ask

File Processing
	1. Edit files in-place (no temporary copies)
	2. Process one file at a time
	3. After editing each file, verify syntax with: `zig ast-check <filename>`
	4. If syntax check fails, immediately fix the issue before proceeding
	5. Show a summary after each file: filename, number of items documented

IMPORTANT
    - Always ask if you need additional information
    - NEVER execute git commands automatically. Always ask
    - Documentation should include two modules
    - Placement of generated docs now is not important
    - For now don't check generated htmls. after change run zig build.docs.
    - Ask me to check and wait


Show plan before starting of changes


Create two sets of documentation
- one for tofu - target folder apidocs (the same)
- second for recipes - target folder recipes

Fix build.zig accordingly

If it's possible to use the same zig build docs - OK
Otherwise create two and run both. Explain what I need to run.

Don't check generated htmls. after change run zig build.docs.
Ask me to check and wait

Instructions for me:
    For Tofu docs:
      python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory zig-out/docs_site/docs/apidocs/
      Open: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

   For Recipes docs:
      python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory zig-out/docs_site/docs/recipes/
      Open: http://127.0.0.1:8080/
