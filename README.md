##
A “cool” slogan. 

But what does **tofu** have to do with a library for 
_asynchronous message communication_?

I spent a long time racking my brain trying to explain the _point_ of this project.

There are already tons of networking libraries out there. 

Well, let’s say at least “half a kilo” for Zig. 

And then it hit me — **tofu**!

Tofu is a simple product with almost no flavor. You can
- eat it plain with no fuss
- add a little spice and make something simple
- or go all the way and create culinary masterpieces.

And what I like specially:
>[tofu is as good as you are a cook](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/hguwpc/tofu_is_as_good_as_you_are_a_cook/)

Similar you will use the tofu library: 
- from minimal setups 
- to more complex flows
- and eventually distributed applications.

## A bit of history

_tofu_ wasn’t “pulled out of thin air.”

I started developing a similar system back in 2008, maintained it, and kept it running for years.

That system powered all data exchange in a serious distributed environment 
- from basic IPC 
- to communication in a proprietary distributed file system.

We’ve “parted ways” for a few years now, but I haven’t heard any complaints yet.

Corporate lawyers can relax — from that old system I only took the _scent_. 

By that I mean the idea itself: 
- messaging as the foundation
- the philosophy of gradual evolution 
  - starting from something simple 
  - and steadily growing into more advanced and powerful systems.

## API
You won’t find the tofu API here yet.

As development moves forward, I’ll be preparing proper documentation.

A link will be added at the time of project “publication.”

## Why not use another library?
Why not? — Go ahead and use it.
