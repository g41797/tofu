What does **tofu** have to do with a library for 
_asynchronous message communication_?

I spent a long time breaking my head trying to explain the _point_ of this project.

There are already tons of networking libraries out there. 

Well, let’s say at least several kilograms for Zig. 

And then it hit me — **tofu**!

Tofu is a simple product with almost no flavor. You can
- eat it plain 
- add a little spice and make something slightly better
- or go all the way and create culinary masterpieces.

And what I especially like:
>[tofu is as good as you are a cook](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/hguwpc/tofu_is_as_good_as_you_are_a_cook/)

You'll use the tofu library in a similar way: 
- from minimal setups 
- to more complex flows
- and eventually distributed applications.

## A bit of history

**tofu** wasn’t just "pulled out of thin air."

I started developing a similar system back in 2008, maintained it, and kept it running for years.

That system powered all data transfer in a serious distributed environment 
- from basic IPC 
- to communication in a proprietary distributed file system.

We parted ways a few years ago, but I haven't heard any complaints yet.

Corporate lawyers can relax — from that system I only took the _smell_
([precedent case about paying for smell](http://fable1001.blogspot.com/2009/11/nasreddin-hodja-smell-of-soup-and-sound.html))

By '_smell_' I mean the idea itself: 
- messaging as the foundation
- the philosophy of gradual evolution 
  - starting from something simple 
  - and steadily growing into more advanced and powerful systems.

## API
You won’t find the tofu API here.

As development moves forward, I’ll be preparing proper documentation.

A link will be added when the project is ready for release.

## Why not use another library?
Why not? — Go ahead and use it.
