# About AI Generated Documents

**_99.99%_** of the code was written manually, without AI.

AI‑generated docs were created later, after the main development, as part of a post‑mortem review.  
They were added to the site to make the project easier to understand and port to other languages.

They look at tofu from different angles. 
And although there’s a lot of repeated information, 
maybe that’s not a bad thing — as long as it’s true 😊.

Really enjoyed reading these docs — learned a lot of new things. 
Don’t agree with everything, but nobody’s right all the time.
