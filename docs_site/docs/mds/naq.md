!!! question "What's NAQ?"
I always wondered why even if the program is not used by anyone,
there is still a FAQ section.
Even if a question was asked once, why 'frequently'?
That's why I use a more honest name:
**_NAQ_** - **N**ever **A**sked **Q**uestions.
I ask myself. I answer myself. You didn't ask. **_Not even about NAQ_**.


You will see '**_NAQ_**' sections in different places throughout this documentation.
I hope they will help clarify the content of the documentation.
