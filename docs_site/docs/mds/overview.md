**tofu** is an _asynchronous_ **Zig messaging library** used to:

- Build **custom** communication flows.
- Create **non-blocking** systems.
- Enable **peer-to-peer** messaging between applications.

**Tofu** is a completely new project, not a port.

Built in **native Zig**:

- protocol engine
- message handling
- Linux and macOS backends

and use only the _standard library_.

Windows backend is based on [wepoll](https://github.com/piscisaureus/wepoll).

## Why tofu?

As a food, **tofu** is simple and doesn’t have much flavor on its own.  
With tofu cubes, you can:

- Eat them plain as an easy snack.
- Add some spice to make them better.
- Cook up something really tasty.

As a **protocol**, tofu uses **messages** like cubes. By "cooking" these messages together, you can grow your project:

- Start with **minimal setups**.
- Build **complex flows**.
- Create full **distributed applications**.

!!! quote "Remember"
    tofu is as good as you are a cook.

## A Bit of History

**tofu** did not come from nowhere.

The journey began in 2008 when I first built a similar system. I maintained and ran that system
for many years in high-stakes environments. It powered everything from basic IPC to complex data transfers in a custom distributed file system.

I left that project a few years ago, but I haven't heard any complaints yet — the systems are still running strong.

Corporate lawyers can stay calm: I didn't take any code. I only took the "**smell**."
(See the [precedent case about paying for a smell](http://fable1001.blogspot.com/2009/11/nasreddin-hodja-smell-of-soup-and-sound.html)).

By "**smell**," I mean the core philosophy:

- **The Message is the API**: The data itself defines the connection.
- **Gradual Evolution**: Start with something simple and grow it into a powerful system over time.
- **The Mantra**: "Connect your developers. Then connect your applications."
